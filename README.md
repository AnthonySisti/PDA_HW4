# Goal
The focus of this assignment is hierarchical models. Students were asked to predict self assessed pain scores for patients suffering from osteoarthritis using a variety of within and between patient factors. Following this, students were taksed with modeling the radon levels in homes, clustering by county, within the state of Minnesota. This was then extended to a three-level model when additional states were included in the data set.
